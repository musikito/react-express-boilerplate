# Express-backend 
this repo is a simple boilerplate for express application with basic features as:

**This setup works with local instance of mongo only if you have mongo installed on your machine**
if you dont have mongo installed you can follow [this](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) instructions. then to start it simply run `sudo mongod` from the command line.


# built-in Auth - using passport-mongoose 
this boilerplate built with passport auth with mongo database: 
simply add your login data in the config.js file and uncomment the necessary part from db/mongoos.js
or , use it as is on localhost. 
passport have to get two fields from the client to work: 
**password** // (must be named "password")
**username** // (must be name "username")

# built-in email activation 
on signup the user will get an email to activate their account 
**note** - that require from you to have a domain name or smtp server to send the email. 
simply add the username and the password from your smtp account in the `.env` file and you good to go. 
on activation - the user schema in the db will be updated with the value "true" on "active" prop. 
then passport can recognize the user as verified account. 
You can find smtp providers [here](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-email.md)

# built-in password reset using email
I added an end point for your users to reset their password if they need to

# protected routes with JWT
when you login token will be generated for you and will be sent to the client where it will be stored in `localstorage`.
then you can use the token to gain access to functions and routes. 




here you can see the backend in action [protected route](./server/routes/protected.js) that you can simply duplicate in any route toy want


# React-frontend
the frontend use React and built with **react-router** by default. You can add your routes in the [Main.js](client/src/Screens/Main/Main.js) file 

# to use 
* simply clone the repo, add the smtp cords as described above inside [.env](./server/.env).




**to use with your remote server dont forget to update the username and the password to your db in [config.js](./server/routes/config.js)**

* then:
```sh
cd server/ 
npm install && npm start
cd client/
npm install && npm start
```
Thats it! now your React front end run on `http://localhost:3000`. and your server run on `http://localhost:3001` 

# Known issues
* setting 
`server` inside [.env](./server/.env) to numeric address (i.e 10.0.0.11) will couse the confirmation email not to be sent. make sure to use alphabetical address
